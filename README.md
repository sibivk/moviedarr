# Moviedarr

> Search · Grab · Watch — automated OTT movie discovery, NZB queuing, and library delivery.

Moviedarr watches [ottmovierelease.com](https://www.ottmovierelease.com) daily, finds new Malayalam / Hindi / Tamil OTT releases, searches nzbs.in for a 1080p grab in the 1–10 GB sweet spot, queues it to NZBGet, and when the download finishes, moves the file into the right language library and triggers a Plex scan — all without touching anything.

---

## Features

### Search & Queue (manual)
- **Instant movie search** via nzbs.in API with extended metadata
- **Smart quality badges** — 4K, 1080p, BluRay, WEB-DL, HDR, HEVC, Dolby Atmos, and more
- **Recommended badge** — highlights results that are 1080p and within the 1–10 GB ideal range
- **IMDb rating chip** — rating and vote count pulled from Newznab metadata
- **Size colour bar** — green < 3 GB · amber 3–7 GB · red 7–10 GB; results > 10 GB filtered out
- **Language selector** — pick Malayalam / Hindi / Tamil before queuing so the file mover knows which library to use
- **One-click Queue** — sends directly to NZBGet via JSON-RPC

### Auto-download (daily 10:00 UTC)
- Scrapes ottmovierelease.com for streaming-only releases in target languages
- Skips movies already in any library (bidirectional fuzzy match — case-insensitive, strips year/quality tokens)
- Searches nzbs.in for smallest 1080p result between 1 GB and 10 GB
- Queues to NZBGet and records the movie with its language in the tracking database

### File mover (every 5 minutes)
- Reads `.moviedarr_ready.log` written by your NZBGet post-process script
- Looks up each completed file's language from the tracking DB
- Moves the file to the correct library (`/libraries/malayalam`, `/libraries/hindi`, `/libraries/tamil`)
- Renames to clean `Title.Year.ext` format
- Deletes the NZBGet download folder from `STORAGE_PATH` once moved
- Triggers a Plex library scan for the affected language section

### UI
- Animated star-field canvas background
- Glassmorphism result cards with staggered fade-in
- OTT shortcut button (top-right) — quick link to ottmovierelease.com
- Activity panel — full history of auto-queued and moved movies, live stats, manual trigger button
- Fully mobile-responsive — compact layout, full-width Queue button, pill language selector on phones
- Toast notifications for every action

### Infrastructure
- Runs as a **Podman Quadlet** systemd user service — starts automatically at boot, no duplicate instances possible
- Single Gunicorn worker (prevents duplicate APScheduler jobs)
- Hairpin-NAT fix auto-detected in start script (NZBGet hostname → host IP)
- SELinux-compatible volume mounts (`:Z`)

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env   # fill in credentials (see table below)
```

### 2. Build & Deploy

```bash
chmod +x podman_start.sh podman_stop.sh
./podman_start.sh
```

Opens at **http://\<SERVER_IP\>:5000**

### 3. (First time) Enable systemd auto-start

The Quadlet file lives at `~/.config/containers/systemd/moviedarr.container`.  
After `./podman_start.sh` runs for the first time, the service is already wired to `default.target` and will start automatically on every reboot.

## NZBGet Post-Process Script

Add a line to your post-process script so the file mover knows a download is ready:

```bash
echo "$(date +%s)|${NZBPP_DIRECTORY##*/}/${NZBPP_NZBNAME}.mkv" >> /path/to/STORAGE_PATH/.moviedarr_ready.log
```

The file mover reads this log every 5 minutes, matches the entry to its tracked language, and moves the file to the correct library.
